## Description

This is a repository for an application that manages content for a tech blog. This application allows users to create an account with username and password that is stored in a database safely using bcrypt hashes and allows users to publish blogs. It allows allows users to comment on other users blogs. There is also a dashboard where a user can see their blogs that they have posted. The application makes use Sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database. It was created in order to allow developers that write about tech a site where they can publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions. As a software developer, I was able to create a working website on both the front end and back end using javascript, express.js, node.js, a database, and a plethora of libraries. I was able to test my skills regarding end to end application development. 

## Usage

In order to use this application, you will need to redirect to the landing page, which can be found >>> [HERE](). At the landing page you will be able to see all blog posts that were posted in order of most recent to oldest. You can create in account by clicking on the 'Login' button in the navigation bar in the header. From there, you can click 'Sign up' Instead' at the bottom and sign up using a unique username and a password of your choosing that is 8 characters in length. After signing up, you will be redirected to your dashboard where you can create a new blog post. You can also choose to go to the homepage by clicking on 'Home' in the navigation bar in the header. After logging in, you will be able to click on a title of a blog and see all the associated comments with that blog. As a user, you will also be able to post your own comments. 

## Credits 

I would like to credit my tutor Joem Casusi for helping me with my routing problems and answering all my questions regarding implementation. I also would like to give credit to the instruction staff for helping me solve issues or answer questions on implementing my ideas.
